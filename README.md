# TUAdventure

In this little text adventure, you are a student of the Technical University of Berlin (http://www.tu-berlin.de).

It is written in Java and does not rely on third-party libraries. Compile it with `javac Adventure.java` and run it with `java Adventure`.

I wrote the original German version on the weekend of May 4th and 5th 2013 and added English translations on May 22nd 2015.
